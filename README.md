# Personal Security Vault

##Objectives:
to design and to develop the Personal Security Vault (PSV) that securely manages passwords and encryption keys for users.

##Features:
Personal Security Vault (PSV) has four main functions. Password Management, Symmetric Encryption Functions, Asymmetric Encryption Functions and Cryptographic Checksum Functions. 

**Password Management**
- PSV assists its users in managing the userâ€™s account login information.
- It allows a user to add, delete, update and search this account login information.

**Symmetric Encryption Functions**
- PSV can be used for storing and managing symmetric encryption keys for the user.
- User could use PSV to import, export or generate symmetric encryption keys, such as AES, DES etc.

**Asymmetric Encryption Functions**
- PSV can be used for storing and managing asymmetric encryption keys for the user.
- User could use PSV to generate an asymmetric key [air, such as 2048-bit RSA key.
- It is also capable of generating digital signatures.

**Cryptographic Checksum Functions**
- PSV is capable of calculating the cryptographic checksums of files.
- It is able to calculate the MD5 and the SHA1 checksums of the files specified by the user.
